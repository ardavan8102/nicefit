# Nice Fit | اپلیکیشن تناسب اندام

Application for fitness workouts and tracking body status.


## ⁉️ About This Project
``` The goal of this project was to work on different complexities of the UI side and less emphasis was given to the backend. Creating a complex UI and nested structure, while at the same time being optimized and attractive, was what I did in this project. ```
## 📚 Things i learned and dealt with

In this project, I got to know and learn some interesting packages like ``flutter_staggered_grid_view, carousel_slider, and circle_chart``. On the other hand, staggered_grid_view required ``CustomScrollView``, so I mastered that as well; things like Slivers are also included in this. Combining these packages with getx had its challenges, but I liked the outcome.
